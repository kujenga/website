My [previous site](/old/) was written completely from scratch. It gave me a valuable understanding of web fundamentals, but as my time grows short, I needed something with a little more tooling built in. Still, I wanted tools that I could understand. After working extensively with [Go](https://golang.org) in my work at [Meta](https://meta.sc), I felt I had a good enough understanding of its templating system to commit to using it as a the building blocks for my own website. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) seemed a great candidate to build my site off of, and it would be a great test run for what would eventually become the foundation of [Meta's "new" website](https://github.com/rastech/website), at least in the backend generation.

So, I cobbled this together using bootstrap and some other bits and pieces from around the web. Since it's a static site and will be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), comments need to be handled externally. I'm working on getting comments up and running using [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org) on my Digital Ocean droplet, but after running into some roadblocks getting that up and running, for now I'll somewhat begrudgingly be using [Disqus](https://disqus.com).

I plan on posting new and potentially retrospective content on here as my increasingly scarce time allows me to explore things on the side. Hope you enjoy!

## About me
### I've been building things all my life

Today my work focuses on building AI software for tax professionals as CTO at
[Additive AI](https://www.additive.ai/).

Previously I was the architect for all Generative AI products within Salesforce
Industries. I joined Salesforce in November 2019 via the acquisition of Diffeo,
where I was co-founder. Diffeo and the company I'd co-founded prior, Meta
Search, were aimed at helping make sense of the world's information. Throughout,
I lead our engineering teams in building machine learning and information
retrieval systems to create user experiences that harness information from
unstructured content.

I'm also deeply interested in what we can do to carve a path out of the climate
crisis. Driving innovation forward is our greatest hope to create the level of
monumental change needed to address the threat of climate change.

When I'm not at my computer, you are likely to find me out on a bike or working
my way up a rock wall.

My email is "hi" at "ataylor.io", feel free to reach out!

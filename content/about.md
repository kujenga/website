## About
### I've been building things all my life

Today my work focuses on bringing Collaborative AI to the Salesforce platform.
I am leading engineering teams in building machine learning and information
retrieval systems to create user experiences that harness information from
unstructured content. I joined Salesforce as part of the Diffeo acquisition in
November 2019.

Prior to joining Salesforce, I co-founded Diffeo and Meta Search to help to make
sense of the world's information.

## Projects

### Neural Network in Go
Wrote a neural network [implementation](https://github.com/kujenga/goml) from
scratch in Go. Read more about it [on the blog]({{< ref "/blog/go-mlp.md" >}})!

### Compiling Interpreter for x86 machine code written in ARM assembly language
Created the fastest interpreter in my Computer Architecture class by compiling
translated instructions of the x86 instruction set into mapped sequences of ARM
instructions allowing for much faster runtimes than a standard interpreter.

### Replicated Hosting within a P2P Marketplace
[Forked](https://github.com/kujenga/OpenBazaar) the
[OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar) project in its earliest
stages to emulate a hosted site environment within a P2P network. Used a
[Kademlia](http://xlattice.sourceforge.net/components/protocol/kademlia/specs.html)
distributed hash table to facilitate replicated storage of a user’s site across
multiple peers.

### Electric Powered Off-Road Vehicle
Hand-fabricated a full-suspension metal frame from raw steel tubing. Designed
